Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem and its graphical representation 

The Traveling Salesman Problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point, given a set of cities and the distance between every pair of city. 
	In the package, various places from Coimbatore were considered to be possible input locations. Once the user inputs the places to be visited, all possible distance measures between every pair of city is calculated using the corresponding libraries in python. Then, every possible path to cover all the places is found from which the shortest path is picked out by the algorithm used. The favourable path is graphically represented.
	The language used to code is Python. Python was chosen as it offers wide variety of libraries like matplotlib, goepy and more , and hence is very efficient to use.
